						<h2>Be more active!</h2>
						<p>StepUp helps you &amp; your friends be more active, healthy &amp; awesome by starting some fun, healthy competition. Research has proven that people who track their exercise/activity are more active, and that people who exercise with friends are
							more active.
						</p>
						<p>Medical experts recommend walking ~10,000 steps a day to lead an active, healthy lifestyle. See how you measure up against your friends - cheer or taunt each other and be more active together!

						<div class="panel"> <a class="panel-heading" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseOne"> How does step tracking work with my phone?</a>
							<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
								<div class="panel-body">StepUp uses your phone's built-in step-sensor/fitness tracker. It counts your steps as you as you move with it in your pocket, hand or bag, and works in the background without impacting battery.
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="panel"> <a class="panel-heading collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseTwo"> How is the step tracking so accurate?</a>
							<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse out">
								<div class="panel-body">StepUp uses your phone's built-in step-sensor/fitness tracker, which counts your steps as you as you move with it in your pocket, hand or bag. Some studies show that phone activity trackers are actually more accurate than wearable activity trackers.
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="panel"> <a class="panel-heading collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseThree"> How does this work in the background when my app is not opened?</a>
							<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse out">
								<div class="panel-body">StepUp just uses your phone's built-in step-sensor/fitness tracker, which works in the background without impacting battery. You don't need to have the app opened all the time for it to count your steps.
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="panel"> <a class="panel-heading collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseFour"> How is StepUp so battery-friendly?</a>
							<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse out">
								<div class="panel-body">StepUp just uses your phone's built-in step-sensor/fitness tracker, which works in the background without impacting battery. Apps that use your location drain battery, but since we don't use your location, we are very battery friendly! :)
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="panel"> <a class="panel-heading collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseFive"> How do I add friends in StepUp?</a>
							<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse out">
								<div class="panel-body">All you and your friends need is a smartphone with StepUp. Simply log in with Facebook in StepUp, and you will be able to see your friends who are also on StepUp.
								</div>

						</div>

						<div class="panel"> <a class="panel-heading collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseSix"> How can I block (hide) friends in StepUp?</a>
							<div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse out">
								<div class="panel-body">When you log in with Facebook in StepUp, you will be able to see your friends who are also on StepUp. You can privately block any of these friends in StepUp - then you won't see blocked friends in StepUp, and they won't see you in StepUp. <br>
								This is only within the StepUp app, and doesn't affect Facebook in any way. You can unblock them at anytime.
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="panel"> <a class="panel-heading collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseSeven"> Who can see my steps?</a>
							<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse out">
								<div class="panel-body">When you log in with Facebook in StepUp, you will be able to see your friends who are also on StepUp, and they will be able to see you in StepUp. <br>
								You can see you friends today's steps, yesterday's steps &amp; 7-day average steps. Similarly, your friends who're on StepUp can see your today's steps, yesterday's steps &amp; 7-day average. <br>
								Also, in the friend head to head page, you can see your best day steps &amp; best week steps.

						<div class="panel"> <a class="panel-heading collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseEight"> Which phones are supported?</a>
							<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse out">
								<div class="panel-body">StepUp works on iOS &amp; Android - for all phones that have a step sensor.<br>

						<div class="panel"> <a class="panel-heading collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseNine"> Why is my phone not supported?</a>
							<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse out">
								<div class="panel-body">StepUp uses a smartphone's built-in step-sensor/fitness tracker.
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="panel"> <a class="panel-heading collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseWearables"> Do you support wearables like FitBit, Jawbone, Apple Watch, Microsoft Band?</a>
							<div id="collapseWearables" class="panel-collapse collapse out">
								<div class="panel-body">StepUp currently uses smartphones' built-in step-sensor/fitness tracker to count your steps because almost everyone has (or will have) a smartphone and carries it around all day. So there's no need to buy, wear, recharge &amp; sync a wearable device to track your steps in StepUp.<br>
								However, we are planning to sync with HealthKit/Google Fit in the future, and you will be able to see your steps from there in StepUp - so if your wearable syncs with either, it will work with StepUp soon. Let us know which wearable you want to use with StepUp at <a style="color: #428bca" href="mailto:feedback@thestepupapp.com" target="_top">feedback@thestepupapp.com</a>, so we can prioritize integration accordingly.

						<div class="panel"> <a class="panel-heading collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseTen"> Who built StepUp?</a>
							<div id="collapseTen" class="panel-collapse collapse out">
								<div class="panel-body">Pratik wanted to use a step tracking app that was social, engaging &amp; fun - but was surprised to see that he couldn't find one. So he prototyped StepUp with his friends Pranip &amp; Aashna, and all of them got hooked on to it. They've been building it as a labor of love ever since.
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="panel"> <a class="panel-heading collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapseEleven"> I love the app - can I buy you a coffee?</a>
							<div id="collapseEleven" class="panel-collapse collapse out">
								<div class="panel-body">Thank you - nothing makes our day more than a happy user! :) <br>
									Luckily, we're managing to keep StepUp free for now (and the foreseeable future), but you can help us out by telling your friends about StepUp, writing a review on the AppStore and spreading the love! :)
